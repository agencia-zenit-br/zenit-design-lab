# Zenit visual conformance — implementation gate

Status: **PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION — NOT FINAL VISUAL APPROVAL**. Updated 2026-10-16.

## Authority and precedence

The binding design baseline is [design-decisions.md](design-decisions.md).
The explicitly selected **Integrated Workspace V3.0 screenshot** (2026-10-12) is the visual reference; its exact pixel rendering must be compared with the original image during browser QA. Later approvals V3.1.2–V4.5.1 consolidate the global application shell. Where earlier component-specific exploration (for example 03.34 sidebar) conflicts with the later accepted **horizontal navigation** of V3.0–V4.5.1, use the later integrated shell for the application and retain separate sidebar rules only for contexts requiring hierarchical module navigation.

Earlier prototypes and the current React demo do not override approved decisions.

## Applied to the 2026-10-16 preview branch

| Required baseline | Approved specification | Code state | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Neutral color tokens | V3.0 / V3.2 / V4.3: #f5f5f5, #ffffff, #191919, #111111, #476b59 | Implemented as CSS variables in `styles.css` | Static guard; browser visual QA pending |
| Horizontal pill navigation | V3.0 / V3.1.2 / V4.5.1 | Implemented in `DesignLab.tsx` | Keyboard and browser QA pending |
| Shared product appearance | V3.5 / V4.5.1; product changes must not change control colors | Implemented: no product-specific palette overrides | Static guard; browser comparison pending |
| Compact control proportions | V1.1, V3.3: approx. 27/32/37px buttons | Implemented in `components.tsx` + `styles.css` | Browser dimensions and touch accessibility pending |
| Fine SVG icons, not characters | V1.3.2, V3.1.2; icon refinements | Initial unified inline SVG family in `Icon.tsx` | Full approved icon asset parity **not verified** |
| Spacing and margins | V3.6.1 / V4.3: 4/8/12/16/24/32px; container 12/16/24px | Standard 16px and compact 12px in prototype | Layout inspection pending |
| Mobile without horizontal scrollbar | V3.0 screenshot, V3.1.2, V3.7, V4.5.1 | Navigation grid, data cards, wrapping controls; removed horizontal table strip | Viewport tests 320/375/390/768px pending |
| Editor contextual width | V2.7.2 / V3.8: full available width with inner padding | Available workspace uses full width; editorial split adapts at 900px | Visual comparison pending |
| States without layout shift | V3.3 / V4.4 | Basic hover/focus/disabled/semantic feedback | All component states not fully implemented |
| Accessibility and RTL/LTR | Global 03.04 and accessibility baseline | Basic labels/focus/logical CSS, some native control semantics | Not certified; keyboard and RTL tests pending |
| Advanced editable tables | Lab 03.03 + 03.49 + V3.7 | Only cell edits, bulk selection, column chevrons and data reflow | Drag, resizing, clipboard, range, undo and redo **missing** |
| Unified rich media editor | V16 plus editors 03.50–03.53 | **Not in this demo** | Separate implementation required |
| Product-specific functional applications | Platform and ZMC | Simulated demonstration only | Not connected to backend |

## Non-negotiable workflow

1. Read the relevant approved sections and newer superseding decisions **before changing code**.
2. Map approved/required/proposed/in-review items separately. Never treat an in-review visual as approved.
3. Preserve visual decisions across products, theme and viewport. Keep lab diagnostics out of customer screens.
4. Add or update conformance evidence with each visual change; do not claim completed implementation merely because it builds.
5. Run `npm run check:design`, `npm run build`, then browser QA in both modes at **320, 375, 390, 768, 1024, 1440px**. Check `document.documentElement.scrollWidth <= window.innerWidth`, keyboard, icon alignment, padding, content flow and visible selected/focus/disabled states.
6. Compare against the original V3.0 image; the file is referenced in the decisions but is **not present as a versioned image asset** in this repository. Do not claim pixel-equivalence until provided or recovered and compared.
7. Never deploy/move to production merely because visual QA or preview CI passes.

The automated static design guard is a regression detector, **not** screenshot/dimensional/browser certification.
